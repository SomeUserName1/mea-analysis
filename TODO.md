    - [x] import
    - [x] model
    - [x] Event
    - [x] selection & electrode grid
    - [x] preproc
    - [ ] analyze
    - [ ] webapp
- [ ] adjust plotting with PyQtGraph
- [ ] make runtime errors/all errors visible on UI
- parallelization: 
    - [ ] make sure to use numpy vetorization
    - [ ] Dask or WorkerPools; 
- [ ] Improve peak & burst detection
