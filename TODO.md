    - [ ] preproc
    - [ ] analyze
    - [ ] webapp
- create tag
- [ ] adjust plotting with PyQtGraph
- [ ] make runtime errors/all errors visible on UI
- parallelization: 
    - [ ] make sure to use numpy vetorization
    - [ ] Dask or WorkerPools; 
- [ ] Improve peak & burst detection
- [ ] Detect bad channels using pyprep, SNR, impedances
- add elephant functionality
    - [ ] LFP & Population signals
    - [ ] Spike trains
    - [ ] combined
